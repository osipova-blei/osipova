  <p>Hello. My name is Ekaterina and I’m currently a Master’s student of science and technology studies (STS) at the University of Vienna.</p>
    <p>I am interested in a range of topics focusing on gender and sexuality and their intersections with science and technology, queer and trans health, public engagement with techno-science, hacking, and tinkering. I am particularly fond of post-actor-network-theories like ontological politics, assemblage thinking, and care in/for techno-science.</p>

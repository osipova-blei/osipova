  <p>Hello. My name is Ekaterina and I’m currently a Master’s student of science and technology studies (STS) at the University of Vienna.</p>
    <p>I am interested in a range of topics focusing on gender and sexuality and their intersections with science and technology, queer and trans health, public engagement with techno-science as well as hacking and tinkering. I am particularly fond of post-actor-network-theories like ontological politics, assemblage thinking, and care in/for techno-science.</p>
     <p>Currently I am writing my master’s thesis on trans people’s perspectives on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treatment, their experiences with the medical system, as well as their envisionings of an inclusive and attentive PCOS care. <br> Also I am a research assistant at the Department of Science and Technology Studies at the University of Vienna.</p>
